# Search

Docupulse uses **AI-powered semantic search** to understand the intent behind your queries — not just the exact words.

## Key Capabilities

- **Concept-Aware Queries**: Searching for “profit margin Q1” may surface “EBIT margin” or “Q1 financial results” even if the phrase “profit margin” isn’t explicitly used.
- **Multiple Queries at Once**: Run several searches in parallel to cover different documentation angles.
- **Preview Results**: Highlights and excerpts show where the relevant information was found in the source document.

## How to:

### Create a Query
