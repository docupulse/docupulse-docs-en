With Docupulse, you can:

- **Cross-reference** sheet ranges or cells with specific locations in your PDFs or Word documents.

- Perform real-time **semantic search** across all your documents.

- **Extract** and insert relevant data directly into Excel for analysis.

- Automate **summaries and conclusion** generation.

# How It Works
Docupulse operates as a sidepane within Microsoft Excel. Users log in to access their workspaces and explore stored documents directly from Excel.

# Platform
Docupulse is Microsoft-Azure Cloud hosted, thus, it allowed to link unlimited amounts of documents to an Excel file. This works for local as well as browser-based Excel.
