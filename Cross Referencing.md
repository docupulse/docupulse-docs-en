# 3. Cross-Referencing

One of Docupulseâ€™s standout features is its **cross-referencing capability**. You can link a specific cell or range in Excel (e.g., a cost center or dividend calculation) to the exact location in a PDF or Word document that backs up that data.

## Examples

- **Cost Analysis**: Reference a service agreement of a supplier, so you always know the exact source of each cost entry.
- **Shareholder Agreement**: Connect a clause describing dividend distribution terms to the corresponding Excel cell that calculates payouts.

## Benefits

- **Dynamic Linking**: Link Excel cells, pivot tables, or ranges directly to specific sections of any PDF or Word document.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: When referencing a figure (e.g., cost, revenue, or clauses in a contract), you can jump straight to the exact location in the source document.
- **Integrated Viewer**: View full documents from within Excel, jump to relevant excerpts, and correlate them with your data.
