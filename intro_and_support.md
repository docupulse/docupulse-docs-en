# How It Works
Docupulse operates as a sidepane within Microsoft Excel. Users log in to access their workspaces and explore stored documents directly from Excel.

# Platform
Docupulse is Microsoft-Azure Cloud hosted, thus, it allowed to link unlimited amounts of documents to an Excel file. This works for local as well as browser-based Excel.
